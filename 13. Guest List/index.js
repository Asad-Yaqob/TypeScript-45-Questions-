//Question: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var myGuests = ["Abdul Samad", "Sana", "Rohaan"];
for (var i = 0; i < myGuests.length; i++) {
    var guest = myGuests[i];
    console.log("Hey ".concat(guest, ", Im arrange a dinner at my place on Saturday and your specially invited. Don't be late! "));
}
