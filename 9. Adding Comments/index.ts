//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//Program # 1
//In this program, I simply stored a name in a variable and then print the variable with  a message.
let personName = "Shabana";
console.log(`Hey ${personName}, would you like to learn how to cook biryani?`);

//Program # 2
//In this program, I just stored a name in a variable and then coverted the name into uppercase, lowercase and Titlecase. and simply print the converted name.
let userName = "xeLana";
console.log(userName.toLowerCase());
console.log(userName.toUpperCase());
console.log(userName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + userName.slice(1));
